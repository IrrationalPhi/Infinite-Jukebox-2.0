# Infinite-Jukebox-2.0

Are video game OST mp3's not long enough for you?

Do you want Azure Arbitrator to play for as long as the final poss of Azure?

**You've come to the right place!**

Inspired by [Nolan Nicholson](https://nolannicholson.com/2019/10/27/looping-music-seamlessly.html), this program finds the best loop points of a track using mathematical and statistical methods (algorithm by him), with the added functionality of exporting an extension to an mp3 file if needed. The outputted files should be of the same quality, and the ``fading out`` effect should be present only at the end. To begin, the libraries at requirements.txt must be installed.

To run the file, run ``python InfiniteJukebox2.py`` on the terminal with this folder as the working directory, and a new window should open. From there, click on ``Select Track`` to select the desired mp3 file in your computer. You then have an option to either play the track infinitely, or output an extended version of the track. If the latter, the extended track will be located in the same folder with the name {trackname}Extended.mp3. 

Refer to requirements.txt for required python libraries. To use, run ``python InfiniteJukebox2.py`` with this folder as the working directory in the terminal and a new window should open.
